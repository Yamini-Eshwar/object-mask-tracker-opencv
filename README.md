# 🎯 Object Mask Tracker with OpenCV

This is a simple yet powerful project built using OpenCV and Python to isolate and track colored objects from a live webcam feed using **HSV color masking** — the first step toward building real-time object tracking systems.

---

## 💡 What It Does

- Captures video from your webcam  
- Converts each frame to HSV color space  
- Lets you tune color ranges using interactive sliders  
- Creates a **binary mask** for a selected color (like blue)  
- Filters and displays only that object in real-time

---

## 🔍 Why It Matters

This mask-based filtering is the **foundation of object tracking**.  
It helps computers answer the first question:
> **“Where is the object?”**

Once located, you can:
- Draw contours
- Track movement
- Predict motion
- Build intelligent CV applications
